{"tgt": "false", "gen_a": "false", "gen": "Without specific context or information about the claim, it's hard to definitively say whether it was true or false. However, according to generally available historical data, the federal loan guarantee to Solyndra was made under the Obama administration's U.S. Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program. This investment was made as an effort to promote renewable energy and stimulate the economy. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, to the best of my knowledge, did not directly administer or approve this federal loan guarantee, which was part of a broader national energy policy. Therefore, the claim seems likely to be false, although it may depend on a specific context or deeper level of involvement not typically ascribed to a single representative."}
