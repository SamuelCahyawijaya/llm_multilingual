To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state .

Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten .

The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention .

In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .", "A: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?", "B: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week .

The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .", "A: What are your strengths and weaknesses ?", "B: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done .

I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .", "A: When do you find a job satisfying ?", "B: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .", "A: How would your coworkers describe you ?", "B: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm .
