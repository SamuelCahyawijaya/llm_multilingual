Brower combed through personal experiences and anecdotes from the house staff, revealing a distinct dynamic between each presidential family and their staff members. Interesting stories include the staff working late hours due to the preference of the Kennedys and Clintons for late-night entertaining, the Nixons frequenting a basement bowling alley, and intense complaints of former First Ladies. The book also delves into the financial strains of running the White House and the living costs that each First Family must cover. Roselyn Carter also controversially hired a convicted murderess as their daughter's nanny, a decision that was ultimately vindicated when the woman's verdict was reversed.

{"gen": "Sam Holtz, a 12-year-old from Lake Zurich, Illinois, beat out 11.5 million entries to win the ESPN Tournament Challenge, predicting the victory of Duke in the NCAA championship game. However, despite the astonishing accomplishment, Sam did not win the actual grand prize - a $20,000 Best Buy gift card and a trip to the Maui Jim Maui Invitational college basketball tournament in Hawaii - due to contest rules stating entrants must be at least 18 years old. Despite the ESPN offering consolation goodies, Sam suggested he deserved something substantial like an Xbox for his achievement. Unfortunately, winning the prize also required being selected from the top 1% of entries in a random draw. At the end of the tournament, Sam offered advice for others to \"just pick teams that you really like\", as unpredictability is the essence of March Madness.", "tgt": "Sam Holtz beat out 11.5million entries to win the ESPN Tournament Challenge on Monday .
