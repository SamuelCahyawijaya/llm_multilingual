Some argue it saved jobs by injecting needed liquidity into a seized-up economy, while others claim its costs outweighed its benefits. As for the specific claim about Steve Kagen causing the loss of 77,000 jobs, this would be difficult to directly attribute to a single person's actions or votes, considering the wide array of factors that can impact an economy and jobs.

However, this doesn't mean that they accounted for 70 percent of all jobs created in America. The proportion can fluctuate quite significantly based on the timeframe one looks at.
