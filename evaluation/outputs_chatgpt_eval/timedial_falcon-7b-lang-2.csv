B: Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ?

A:Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ?
B: I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced .
A: There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ?
B: I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world .
A: Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ?
B: I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger .

A:Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ?
B: What ? Why do we have to do that ?
A: Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
B: I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
A: That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !

A:In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
B: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
A: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
B: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , ' When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or <MASK> . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . '

"Given the conversation:
A:Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting .
B: What is it , Mrs . Wang ?
A: It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us <MASK> , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them .
B: Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ?
A: Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable .
B: Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage .
A: The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .
B: As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export .
A: I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss .
B: The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment .
A: We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage .
B: That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage .
A: To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us .
B: Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case .
A: Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim .

A:Good morning . I ' d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies .
B: Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ?
A: I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content .
B: I see . Here ' s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ' Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are .
A: I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home .
B: Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles .
A: In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?
B: It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit .
A: Oh , I see . That ' s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?
B: If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .
A: It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree .
B: We initially sign <MASK> policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year .
A: If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ' Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months .

B: Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan .

B: Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ' t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ' s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair .

A:Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?
B: I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ' s better to get to know it . What about you ?
A: I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .
B: Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .
A: Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .
B: But I ' m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?
A: Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .
B: I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ' t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?
A: That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ' s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .
B: Really ?
A: Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .
B: Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?
A: Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .
B: How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?
A: That ' s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
B: So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?
A: Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .
B: Why did they want to found a college ?
A: Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
B: Oh , I see .
A: Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .
B: When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?
A: In <MASK> , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .
B: It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
A: Therefore , it ' s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .
B: Wow , I didn ' t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .
A: Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .
B: I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .
A: Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .
B: That ' s right . I have a lot to learn from you .
A: You can ask me any question at any time .

Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair .

A: In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ' s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect .
B: Cool ! Is that why we only work <MASK> now ?
A: Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality .
B: And then what happened ?
A: Well , as we say , the rest is history ...

A:Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am .
B: He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack .
A: Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ?
B: Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept .

B: Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ?
A: Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ' s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ' s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting .
B: I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable .
A: Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ' s a G-rated movie ! It ' s for the kids ! It ' s not a thriller !
B: Well , that ' s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ' s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ' s just too cliche .
A: How can it be cliche ? It ' s a fable ! It ' s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love .

A:What's your ideal boss ?
B: I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout <MASK> after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone .

A:Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?

A: Yeah , that's very important .
B: So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .

B: That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually <MASK> .
A: It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .
B: It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
A: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
B: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
A: It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
B: You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
A: I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
B: You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .

Answer: [LABELS_CHOICE]",2,"['0', '1']"
"Given the conversation:
A:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .
B: I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .
A: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?
B: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
A: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?
B: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .
A: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .
B: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
A: What are your strengths and weaknesses ?
B: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
A: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .

B: We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too .

A:I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ?
B: Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven .
A: And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ?
B: Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars .
A: Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ?
B: As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system .
A: That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess .
B: It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them .
A: So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars .
B: Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course .
A: You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised .
B: No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units .
A: In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra .
B: I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately .
A: Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet .
B: I understand , Ma'am .
A: And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars .
B: It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after <MASK> .
A: I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept .
B: Well .
A: You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 .
B: Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business .
A: Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible .

"Given the conversation:
A:In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off .
B: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord .
A: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage .
B: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , ' When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was <MASK> . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . '
A: It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable '

A: Yeah , that's very important .
B: So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .
A: I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
B: That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
A: It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .
B: It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
A: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
B: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
A: It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
B: You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
A: I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
B: You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
A: It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
B: It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .

A:So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...
B: We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...
A: That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year <MASK> , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .

A:Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background .
B: I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used .
A: What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ?
B: Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input .
A: Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ?
B: There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost <MASK> , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort .
A: Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome .
B: I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done .
A: What are your strengths and weaknesses ?
B: My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more .
A: Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss .
B: I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day .
A: When do you find a job satisfying ?
B: My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner .
A: How would your coworkers describe you ?
B: First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously .

B: I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products .
A: Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line .
B: Thank you .
A: But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end .
B: That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ?
A: 500 pieces .
B: No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts .
A: All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission .
B: I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged .
A: We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
B: No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction .
A: Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products .

B: It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them .

B: No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units .
A: In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra .
